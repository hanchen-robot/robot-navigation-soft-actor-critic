# robot-navigation-soft-actor-critic

The goal of this project was to implement the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm for mobile robot navigation within a 2D simulation environment. Configured in MATLAB, the code evaluated reinforcement learning-based obstacle avoidance and path planning. This work was forked from (https://github.com/brnbq22/path-planning-sac). Based on this version, the development aims to further improve the project's visualization results, including:

- The original version contained Vietnamese code comments. This version adds English and Chinese comments.
